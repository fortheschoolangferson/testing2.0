</h1>
<br>
<span style="color: #588BAE; font-family: Verdana; margin: 400px; font-size:20px;"> 1. &nbsp;  Study everyday</span>
<p>
<style>
p {
margin: 30px 250px 10px 250px;
}
</style>
<span style="color: #588BAE; font-family: Verdana; font-size:20px;"> If you study consistently everyday, your memory will be constantly going over what you’ve learned. This clarifies things for you. Additionally, it relieves the pressure of last-minute cramming. Early in the year, one or two hours per night can be plenty to keep up with everything. You might need to put in extra study time each day later in the year.</span>
</p>
<br>
<br>
<span style="color: #588BAE; font-family: Verdana; margin: 400px; font-size:20px;"> 2. &nbsp;  Stay Motivated</span>
<p>
<style>
p {
margin: 30px 250px 10px 250px;
}
</style>
<span style="color: #588BAE; font-family: Verdana; font-size:20px;"> It is helpful to remember your motivations for working so hard in your studies, such as the course or career you are pursuing. Having a reminder of your objectives in your study place can be beneficial.</span>
</p>
<br>
<span style="color: #588BAE; font-family: Verdana; margin: 400px; font-size:20px;"> 3. &nbsp;  Always take care of yourself</span>
<p>
<style>
p {
margin: 30px 250px 10px 250px;
}
</style>
<span style="color: #588BAE; font-family: Verdana; font-size:20px;"> Taking care of yourself will help you study more effectively. Make sure you eat healthfully, get enough rest, and exercise. Avoid pushing yourself to study late into the night or rewarding yourself with too many fatty or sugary snacks.  It's a good idea to make sure you get plenty of water when studying.</span>
</p>
<br>
<span style="color: #588BAE; font-family: Verdana; margin: 400px; font-size:20px;"> 4. &nbsp;  Review and Revise</span>
<p>
<style>
p {
margin: 30px 250px 10px 250px;
}
</style>
<span style="color: #588BAE; font-family: Verdana; font-size:20px;">  You ought to review what you learned in class at least once a week. You can better understand concepts by giving them some thought, which will also help you remember them for when you most need them.</span>
</p>
<br>
<span style="color: #588BAE; font-family: Verdana; margin: 400px; font-size:20px;"> 5. &nbsp;  Ask for help</span>
<p>
<style>
p {
margin: 30px 250px 10px 250px;
}
</style>
<span style="color: #588BAE; font-family: Verdana; font-size:20px;"> If you get stuck or don’t understand something, don't be shy to ask for help. You can always ask your teacher, your parents, your friends or your classmates.
